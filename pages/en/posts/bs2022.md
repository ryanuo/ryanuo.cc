## Front-End Functional Design

### Libraries Used in the Front-End

- `Vue3`
- `vant3`
- `echart` for data analysis
- `swiper` for carousel effects
- `html2canvas` for poster creation
- `nprogress` for request loading
- `compressorjs` for image compression

### Front-End Performance Optimization

1. Use webpack to analyze performance-consuming files and plugins (BundleAnalyzerPlugin) and separate them one by one.
2. Use CDN for static acceleration. Common components like Vue, vant, swiper, echart, and html2canvas are loaded via CDN (handled differently for production and online environments).
3. Enable Gzip acceleration for both front-end and back-end. The front-end generates compressed files using gzip, and the back-end uses nginx to enable gzip static acceleration.
4. Use asynchronous loading for components. Vue3's `defineAsyncComponent` is used to separate asynchronous components into individual chunks.

## Back-End Introduction

### Technologies Used in the Back-End

- YOLO-v5
- Flask
- Tornado (using Tornado's WSGI module to host Flask applications)
- flask_restful for modular handling and easier maintenance
- MySQL 8.0.23
