### Gold Buying Process (Using JD Finance as an Example)

1. **Account Setup**

- Download the JD Finance app → Complete identity verification → Link your bank account.

2. **Fund Transfer**

- Recharge your gold account balance via bank card or JD Xiaojinku.

3. **Buying Gold**

- Path: Finance Channel → JD Gold → Enter amount/weight → Confirm real-time gold price and place the order.
- Trading hours:
  - Closed on holidays.
  - 24-hour trading.

4. **Selling and Withdrawal**

- Funds are credited to the gold account immediately after selling. Withdrawals to a bank account incur a 0.3% fee.

### Gold Conversion Methods

1. **Unit Conversion**

- 1 ounce ≈ 31.1035 grams.
- Domestic prices are quoted in "CNY/gram," while international prices are quoted in "USD/ounce."

2. **Exchange Rate Impact**

- Domestic gold price = International gold price (USD/ounce) × RMB exchange rate ÷ 31.1035.
- Example: International gold price is $2000/ounce, exchange rate is 7.2 → Domestic gold price ≈ 462.8 CNY/gram.

### Onshore vs Offshore & Domestic Gold Price Rationality

1. **Reasons for Price Differences**

- Onshore gold price: Quoted by the Shanghai Gold Exchange (includes VAT, transportation costs, etc.).
- Offshore gold price: International London Gold (LBMA), without tax or fees.
- Price difference is usually 1%-3%, mainly due to:
  - RMB exchange rate fluctuations;
  - Domestic supply, demand, and policies (e.g., import controls).

2. **Different Actual Trading Prices**

- Platforms may charge spreads or fees (e.g., JD Finance charges a 0.3% selling fee).

### Frequently Asked Questions

1. **Can I Place Orders Outside Trading Hours?**

- You can submit a reservation order, which will take effect in the next trading session.
- Orders can be placed 24/7, but transactions are executed during specific trading hours: Monday to Friday 9:00-11:30, 13:30-15:00, 21:00-24:00. No trading on public holidays. To avoid timing discrepancies, operate in advance.

2. **Why Is Domestic Gold Price Higher Than Converted Price?**

- Includes buy-sell spreads (platform profit source).
- Premiums may exist.

3. **How to Break Even at High Prices?**

- Single transactions are essentially "cutting losses." Even with full positions, you can achieve this through single trades. The key is to sell high and buy back at a lower price, maintaining the total position (weight). Through multiple high-sell-low-buy operations, you can not only reduce the average holding cost but also potentially gain some price differences.

4. **Where to Check Premiums?**

- Search for "Premium" in the `Pocket Precious Metals` app.
